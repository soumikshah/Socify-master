# Socify-master
It is an android app which fetches facebook and twitter feeds of the users. It was made as a group project. Plan was initially to add Google plus as well. But G+ didn't give access to user's feed, it showed only the content shared by user. So we decided to stop supporting G+ and keep our focus on other two social media. And due to lack of time we decided on making other two social media work flawlessly. It uses Facebook and twitter SDK's and even api's to fetch profile picture and feed. App is currently live on playstore, here's the link  - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=extinguishers.com.socify
